## Overview

CELI comprises several modules, each responsible for a distinct part of the document processing workflow:

- **Processor**: Manages and orchestrates the drafting of documents using language models, acting as the core of the CELI system.
- **Monitor**: Observes and evaluates the performance of the ProcessRunner, ensuring quality and efficiency in automated tasks.
- **Tasks**: Each CELI workflow is a user-defined list of tasks that instruct the agent how to run.
- **Tools**: Tools provide mechansims for CELI to interact with the world.  Tools can be customized for the use case.

These components are in the CELI 'celi_framework.core' package

CELI contains experimental versions of several additional tools that can help develop new use cases more quickly and accomplish different tasks:
- **Pre-Processor**: Converts DOCX documents to a clean Markdown format, making them primed for embedding.
- **Embeddor**: Embeds pre-cleaned text data from source documents, preparing it for machine learning models and data analysis.
- **Mapper**: Focuses on pre-computing mappings between document content, enhancing the efficiency of the embedding process.
- **Post-Monitor**: Evaluates the execution of processes, standardizing task labels and analyzing task quality variations.
- **Mechanic**: Fixes issues identified by the post-monitor, ensuring the system adapts and improves over time.

These components are in `celi_framework.experimental`.

Additionally, `celi_framework.examples` contains examples for applying CELI to different use cases.

## Comparison with Agent-Based Frameworks

CELI represents a paradigm shift in automated knowledge work, distinguishing itself from traditional agentic frameworks through its unique approach to task automation and interaction with large language models (LLMs). Below are key differentiators that set CELI apart:

- **Controller-Embedded LLM Interactions:** Unlike conventional frameworks where the controller scripts orchestrate LLM interactions in a reactive manner, CELI embeds the controller logic directly within LLM prompts. This design philosophy allows for a more seamless and integrated process, enabling the LLM to act upon a broader context and undertake complex tasks with greater autonomy.

- **Beyond Conversation-Like Flows:** Traditional agent-based models often mimic conversational exchanges, limiting the scope and efficiency of task execution. CELI, by contrast, utilizes a pseudo-code structure in its prompts, freeing the interaction model from the constraints of conversational flows. This allows for the development of more sophisticated and task-specific applications without the limitations of a dialogue format.

- **Function Calling Capabilities:** CELI extends the LLM's functionality through an innovative use of function calls within the prompts. This approach transforms the LLM into a dynamic entity capable of retrieving necessary data (getters) and saving produced data (setters), effectively bridging the gap between LLM reasoning and practical application needs.

- **Error Handling and Self-Correction:** A standout feature of CELI is its ability to self-correct and adapt in real-time. In the face of errors or incongruencies, CELI autonomously adjusts its approach, ensuring continuous progress without the need for human intervention at every decision point. This resilience makes CELI particularly suited for handling complex documents and datasets with varying formats and structures.

- **Scalability and Flexibility:** Addressing the challenge of processing voluminous documents and intricate data sets, CELI is designed to scale effortlessly. Its architecture supports both granular tasks and expansive projects, accommodating the diverse needs of automated knowledge work.

- **Comparison with Existing Frameworks:** Existing agent-based frameworks like LangChain, Haystack, and Autogen, while powerful, often face limitations in flow flexibility and dependency on predefined paths or human inputs for decision-making. CELI's controller-embedded design and autonomous capabilities represent a significant evolution, offering a more scalable, efficient, and versatile solution for automated knowledge work.

By fundamentally reimagining the interaction between controllers and LLMs, CELI paves the way for transformative solutions in knowledge work automation. Its innovative approach to task automation, combined with the power of LLMs, marks a new frontier in the development of intelligent, autonomous applications tailored to complex workflows and diverse industry requirements.

## Getting started

<!-- start getting-started -->

[Join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/C5SQNdzV) to ask questions or get involved in our project!

To get an idea of what CELI can do, we have prepackaged an example use case.  In this case, we will have CELI write a wiki page on a topic given an example page and a set of references.

### Install CELI

First, install celi using PIP with the following command:

```bash
pip install celi-framework
```

You can also clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/x3n0cr4735/celi) and install CELI from source.  See [Running CELI from Source](https://celi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/running_celi.html) for info on how to do that.

### Set up a mongo DB server to store documents

CELI uses Mongo to cache LLM responses, store documentsm inspect runs.  If you already have a Mongo server running, you can point Celi to it and it will create a new database called 'celi'.  If not, you can quickly spin up a local mongo server using this docker command:

```bash
docker run --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 -d mongo
```

### Configure your environment

The main script for CELI loads some configuration from environment variables.  The [`python-dotenv`](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) package is used to load these files from a file called `.env` in the current directory.

Create a .env file with an example configuration, copying the file below and substituting in your OpenAI API key.  If you have the repo cloned, you can copy the .env.example file.

    OPENAI_API_KEY=<REPLACE WITH YOUR OPENAI API KEY>
    OUTPUT_DIR=target/celi_output
    DB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/
    EXTERNAL_DB=True
    NO_MONITOR=True
    JOB_DESCRIPTION=celi_framework.examples.wikipedia.job_description.job_description
    TOOL_CONFIG_JSON=celi_framework/examples/wikipedia/example_config.json
    PARSER_MODEL_CLASS=llm_core.parsers.OpenAIParser
    PARSER_MODEL_NAME=gpt-3.5-turbo-16k

### Run the example use case

Once you have the steps above done, you can test your setup by running:

```bash
python -m celi_framework.main
```

This example use case uses the wikipedia page for Led Zeppelin as the example document, and then creates a new wiki page for the Jonas Brothers based on the references cited from their wikipedia page.  The result will be put in the `target/drafts` directory.

Note that running this takes around 30 minutes (roughly).
