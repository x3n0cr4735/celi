The Barren Moors
On your bare rocks, O barren moors,
On your bare rocks I love to lie,—
They stand like crags upon the shores,
Line Or clouds upon a placid sky.

No friend’s cold eye, or sad delay,
Shall vex me now where not a sound
Falls on the ear, and every day
Is soft as silence most profound.

Across those spaces desolate,
The fox pursues his lonely way,
Those solitudes can fairly sate<sup>1</sup>
The passage of my loneliest day.

No more upon these distant wolds<sup>2</sup>
The agitating world can come,
A single pensive thought upholds
The arches of this dreamy home.

Like desert Islands far at sea
Where not a ship can ever land,
Those dim uncertainties to me,
For something veritable stand.

A serious place distinct from all
Which busy Life delights to feel,
I stand in this deserted hall,
And thus the wounds of time conceal.

Within the sky above, one thought
Replies to you, O barren moors!
Between, I stand, a creature taught
To stand between two silent floors.
