Question 3
(Suggested time—40 minutes. This question counts as one-third of the total essay section score.)

Many works of literature feature a rebel character who changes or disrupts the existing state of societal, familial, or
political affairs in the text. They may break social norms, challenge long-held values, subvert expectations, or
participate in other forms of resistance. The character’s motivation for this rebellious behavior is often complex.
Either from your own reading or from the list below, choose a work of fiction in which a character changes or
disrupts the existing state of societal, familial, or political affairs. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how the
complex motivation of the rebel contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole. Do not merely summarize
the plot.

In your response you should do the following:
• Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.
• Provide evidence to support your line of reasoning.
• Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.
• Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.
