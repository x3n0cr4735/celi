RESPONSE:
In her speech, Dove, a renowned poet, employs anecdote, diction, and parallelism in order to advise college graduates on the key values, such as intellectual curiosity, effort, and bravery, that she deems necessary for navigating the world.
Dove's utilization of ambiguous diction instills curiosity and engagement with the patronization of her speech. Through the parallelistic structure of her three main points, Dove shares with the audience of college students that she "wishes you...hunger, hard work, [and] uncertainty" (Dove). Although initially these wishes are interpretable as negatives, their denotation and appear to be ill-omens, Dove explains the figurative meanings which serves to keep the audience attentive. By catching, surprising the audience, Dove is able to clarify her meaning, explaining how when she wished the audience hunger she did not mean physiological want but a continued spiritual and intellectual appetite (Dove). Efforts of rhetoric, like the aforementioned, allow Dove to explain the importance of possessing a desire to learn and take advantage of "following what attracts you" (Dove). This piece of advice seems to inspire students that learning is a continual practice and should actively continue post-usage. Additionally, hard work - Dove explained that "hard work" does not mean back-breaking labor, but instead gaining "an appreciation" for the work that comes before the "big show" (Dove). This strengthens her utilization of diction by creating hard work to mean something that incites a celebrated process, therefore, encouraging people to put effort and enjoy hardships. Similarly, Dove introduced uncertainty to not mean something negative, but instead of comfort because she explains that "sometimes you don't know where you're going" but the only way you'll find out is if you get going (Dove). The quotation illuminates that despite doubts, one individual must be bold to reach out of their comfort zone and grow. Through these ambiguous, multi-faceted words, Dove empowers, inspires her audience to put a twist on and instead possess a more positive outlook on the challenges.
Furthermore, Dove employs her message of the importance and efficiency of her values through personal anecdotes. Dove shares her father's pep talk or at putting "150%" effort into everything one does in order to express his appreciation and impact on both her and her father. As the first African-American research chemist, Dove's father, she understood the importance of hard work and holding oneself accountable. From this, Dove learned the importance of putting in effort and accountability which she shared through telling her own story of how through each stage of her life, from recognizing her voice when "giving class presentations in high school" to being awarded the Pulitzer Prize to being named "Poet Laureate" to joining the "White House celebration" she always used the 150% effort rule. By demonstrating the power of her father's message through both her and her father's stories, Dove not only explains the process but also the effects and impacts gaining her argument credibility.

Sophistication (0–1 points): 0
Although it consistently identifies and explains rhetorical choices, the response does not display a particularly complex understanding of the rhetorical situation. It acknowledges the relationship of the speaker with the audience but does so in a generalized way, focusing on how Dove’s choices “inspire” listeners or lend her argument “credibility.” Although the response demonstrates effective control of language, it does not demonstrate a consistently persuasive or vivid style.
