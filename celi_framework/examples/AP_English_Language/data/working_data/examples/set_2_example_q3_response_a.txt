RESPONSE:
Fear is a powerful motivator that has been used for both good and ill as long as humans have walked the Earth. As a small child, you're taught to fear fires, storms, and lightning, and to be wary of cars while crossing the street as a safety measure. However, using fear as a method of reasoning or as a means to change minds or incite positive change rarely works. Attempts to persuade others through fear are seldom effective and can even sow resentment, inhibiting positive change from occurring.
When I was younger, my parents tried to scare me into obeying them with threats of privilege removal, time being taken away, or simply being confined to my room. This often didn't work. If anything, their attempts to scare me into doing "the right thing" only made me more determined to do the opposite. Any positive changes I could have made to be safer as a child were fought against solely because I disliked being scared into doing things. I indeed resented my parents for trying to control me through fear, which prevented any good they were trying to achieve from taking root. If reasoning and explanations had been given when what I perceived as completely unfair and often unnecessary rules were told to me, perhaps I would have been more receptive. Instead, the fear instilled in me turned into anger and resentment towards those who tried to change my mind, namely my parents.
The use of fear as a motivator also proved unsuccessful in the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, which began at the close of World War Two. Upon discovering that the United States had nuclear weapons, the Soviets stole the secrets of the technology and created their own in response. This theft and the creation of the most powerful weapons known to man at the time were driven by fear. The fear of nuclear war and massive destruction led to a significant spike in the production of nuclear weapons, which had incited the problem. In addition to the fear of death from nuclear weapons that most Americans experienced at that time, there was also suspicion and resentment towards anything perceived as "red" or communist. The concern that the Soviets would kill Americans with nuclear weapons evolved into resentment, which became another motivating factor behind the increased numbers of nuclear warheads in America. It was not until the 1960s that a slight compromise was reached and levels of fear decreased, leading to more cooperation in the 1970s when the number of nuclear weapons was reduced and controlled. This positive change and involvement in the issue of nuclear weapons wasn't brought about by fear, but by a wish for a better future and a willingness to cooperate with others towards a common goal.
While fear is often seen as a potent motivator that drives people to respond quickly and allows them to be persuaded more easily and quickly, this is not always the case. The use of fear to persuade others seldom leads to genuine positive change or persuasion. It most often causes the opposite, as seen in personal experience and in global affairs, especially regarding the Cold War.
