The idea of a "community of voices" sound as though it would work on paper but is rather imperfect when you
delve into the different implications it can hold for the community and just what it means to have a.
While yes it's a very nice idea that we should have something such as a community of voices where peoples
opinions can be expressed as a whole, you have to take a closer look at what that really means. To have a
community of voices, that would mean many people whose back-rounds can vary. With this variation comes the
problem of simply bad opinions. Now I'm not not saying that people shouldn't have the ability to express their
opinions at all, it's a basic human right after all. But there are, to put it simply incorrect opinions out there, ones that
defy what the general mass of people would normally find it wrong. For example, their is already a place where you
can find communities that have a collective voice online; this community of voices can be seen as website and
company called "Twitter". This site actually holds power because of the sheer number people that use it to express
their opinions, as well as the ability for other people to judge these opinions. There is nothing wrong with this, but a
problem arises that can be seen very often in this place where people's lives are ruined from this power though
number, because the mass as a whole believed it the person deserved it or were convinced into believing it.
So yes people deserve to have an opinion and the ability to express it. The implications that can show themselves
when people are given a communitive voice can become quite cruel. While a person may deserve being ridiculed or
judged online becasue of something they said, they don't deserve having their lives ruined even with a bad opinion.
So if an that can happen in a place that isn't even physically real, their could be a lot of suffering to people who are
just dissagreable if their is an actual physical outlet for that kind of behavior.
