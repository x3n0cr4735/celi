In a 2016 interview, Maxine Hong Kingston stated "I think that individual voices are not as strong as a
community of voices. If we can make a community of voices, then we can speak more truths." Although stated very
harshly, I do believe this to be true. As sad as it is, if you are not extremely wealthy or well known, it is likely that
your voice will not be heard. A community of voices is stronger than one and has plentiful power to make change.
One example of a community of voices speaking their truth to make change is the Civil Rights Movement. People
came together from all around the United States to overturn the Jim Crow laws and give African American people
the freedom and rights that they deserved. This movement was made up of protests, acts of bravery, and more by a
very large group of American people. If there was only one voice being used to make these changes, they most
likely would've never been made. A community of voices is certainly stronger than one.
Walkouts and protests have been held to show solidarity to victims of gun violence and raise awareness about the
commonality of shootings in the United States to eventually reach the goal of ending gun violence. When walkouts
are held at schools, news organizations publicize them, spreading the message of all these people. We don't know
what is to come, but these groups of millions of Americans are causing our voices to be heard by people in positions
of power than can help us. This would not be possible with only one voice.
Overall, I believe that Maxine Kingston's claim "I think that individual voices are not as strong as a community of
voices. If we can make a community of voices, then we can speak more truths" is valid. I agree with this claim
because of the historical event, the Civil rights movement, and the ongoing attempt to end gun violence.
