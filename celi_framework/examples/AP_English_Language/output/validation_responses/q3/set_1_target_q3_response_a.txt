What will people hear? A whisper or a song? The voice of the one or the voice of the many, united? One
alone can mean very little until that one voice gains the power of many. Humans are creatures that crave
validation and to fit in, so will they be one alone or be one of many? Will a person be Moses or the Jews?
A community of voices can hold more power than one voice alone, but one voice can be used to inspire
many, as shown throughout history through civil rights protests, Hitler, and the United States.
The United States did not listen to the small protests throughout the nineteenth century regarding people’s
rights. It wasn’t until the twentieth century when the voices of many drowned out the voices of few within
Washington. Posters didn’t matter until held by millions. Black was bad until millions said it wasn’t. And
only then when more were involved than not, did Congress hear and respond. It took an entire Civil War
to see the problem the first time and it took march after march, protest after protest to bring more change
in the 1960s. But eventually, with the voice of millions behind the movement, the government listened
and changed. The million voices said black isn’t bad, something people now realize is true, and got the
world to change because of it. The truth was free and more believed than not. But what became millions
started as few. Friends protesting in a group of three. It wasn’t until voices, figureheads of the Civil
Rights movement, like Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. inspired the millions, that others listened. It
took those few brave voices—barely a whisper in the crowd—to turn into the song of revolution. The few
were inspirations, but it didn’t matter until the millions followed in pursuit. It didn’t matter until the
million’s whispers combined to a song of great strength and perseverance. That’s what brought the truth
forward.
At first, no one feared Hitler alone. Not even when the Nazis began growing in numbers did the rest of the
world turn more than a glance to Germany. It wasn’t until Germany gained communistic allies, also
power-hungry, that the world turned its head to notice. Hitler held power, yes, but did people fear him or
what his millions of followers could do? Hitler was the sergeant who called out orders—that is scary that
his one whispering voice could shout so loud to be heard by all of Germany—but people feared being
killed or imprisoned by his army-men followers. How many were killed personally by Hitler? Versus,
how many were killed by his people, his camps, and his plans? The world stayed ignorant to Hitler when
he was alone. It wasn’t until he had millions protecting him and his truth that people cared. And it was too
late. Ignorance is a bliss. Until it leads to a world war with affects still devastating today, eighty years
later. The world should’ve listened for when his whisper became a voice because that voice became a
shouting song of pain, hate, and destruction.
The United States. Key word: united. It wasn’t until all 13 colonies came together to fight back against
Britain’s royal crown, that Britain did worry. Massachusetts and the people of Boston throwing some tea
in a harbor did nothing but anger Britain. It wasn’t until the colonists across the entire 13 colonies—with
allies in France—that Britain held concern about losing its royal subjects. The truth that colonists wanted
freedom and would stop at nothing to get it, wasn’t realized until it slapped Britain in the face. One
colony alone held no power, only united under one government did the colonists hold any power. It’s why
the United States is called the United States, not the fifty separate states. And the truth of strength in
numbered has reigned true throughout history when allies together beat the strongest lone power. When a
country divided became United once more. When people across a continent came together. That’s where
power to spread the truth becomes reality: in unity.
Figureheads and movements can inspire millions. But alone, they lack power to spread their message
globally. They needed to make their voice heard to hundreds before the hundreds’ voices became millions.
One alone couldn’t spread their truth, unless they had the backup of many supporting and believing that
same truth. It was proved that truth and change didn’t occur until voices like Rosa Parks and Martin
Luther King Jr. inspired millions to spread their truth. It wasn’t until Hitler convinced other countries and
all the people of Germany, that the world heard their voices shouting their truth. And it wasn’t until the
colonies became one nation under God, that Britain heard their cries for life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness. Truth is relative, but people will believe anything if enough people are shouting at them. One
voice can inspire a whisper of truth, but a million voices shouting one truth will hold more power every
time.
