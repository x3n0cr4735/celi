A strong powerful woman gave a push to the future generation of America. First lady Michelle Obama gave a
speech in her final days in administration to encourage students to continue their education after high school. While
speaking to the students at their high school Michelle uses a call to action, ,and broad speaking to relate and push
these students.
Michelle states in her speech "...This right isn't just handed to you..." she makes it very clear to these students that
this "right" is not easy to come about and takes lots of hard work. She reminds them that you will fail and you
cannot take freedoms for granted. But that you need to think of this journey now, you need to plan and make sure
that you can be successful when it comes to that point in life. "And that means getting the best education possible..."
she states telling them to get engaged with this American freedom; resulting in a good job, being able to support
your family, and being a positive force, as she states in paragraph 5.
This first lady wants all students to feel as though they can have a higher education after high school. She never
pinpoints one social group or is directly talking to them, making each students feel like they have a chance at
success after grade school. She is friendly and keeps everyone in mind, Michelle relates to everyone, even people of
many religions, telling them they too can continue their learning of values, "So I want our young people to continue
to learn and practice those values with pride." No one should miss out on education in Michelle Obama's eyes.
Obstacles, problems, money issues and all these experiences can be faced throughout schooling. But Michelle
Obama wants you to know that nothing is impossible, that every minority has the chance to have a higher life. She
pushes us to take that step now to prepare and not let any problem at hand stop you from trying, all students deserve
and should have a education after high school.
