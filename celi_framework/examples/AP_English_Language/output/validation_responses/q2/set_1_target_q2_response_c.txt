In her last speech, Michelle Obama uses comparing and contrasting to convey her message about her
expectations and hope for young people in the United States.
She compares and relates to her and her husband's life leading up to their spot in the White House to an
ordinary citizen. She expresses how they started with very little and with very hard work and time, they were able to
work there way up to becoming the President and First Lady of the United States, which is what the American
Dream is all about. Many ordinary, and even poorer, United States citizens coming from all different backgrounds
and religions can do what they did through hard work and education. She states, "If your family doesn't have much
money, I want you to remember that in this country, plenty of folks, including me and my husband----we started out
with very little. But with a lot of hard work and a good education, anything is possible----even becoming President.
That's what the American Dream is all about." She compares to life to an avaerage citizens life to activiely display
how they are capable of doing exactly what her and her husdand did, while trying to encourage those people to work
hard to get there, putting in effort and continuing their education after high school.
