There is a debate on whether Urban rewilding is the next step to ecological restoration, as its goal is to restore natural processes and habitats in more urban areas. Rewilding is a worthwhile, beneficial approach to preserving nature, as well as implementing it into more city environments.
Enforcing the idea of rewilding in attempts to conserve nature and increase green space sparks opportunity. Writers Jepson, Paul, and Frans Schepers argue that the process "reflects innovation and creates the possibility for a common, but differentiated (situated) mode of conservation" (Document B). Saving as much wildlife as possible is a consistent motive in today's society. In this case, the fresh concept of rewilding will do more good than harm, if anything at all. There is also a matter of future generations to be recognized. Yes, everyone has heard the cliche of "think about the kids and the world they will live in someday," but it stands just as strong. In Document C, Dr. Scott proposes a question to his audience of those who may have their doubts. He asks "If people don't spend any time outside, why are they going to care about their local places let alone the national parks in the distance?" (Document C). Although childhood experiences have evolved over generations, embracing the outdoors should not be something that turns into a fairy tale to future children.
Despite the great effects rewilding may have, there are its downsides as well. Writer Lincoln Garland lists off negatives such as "degradation by trampling, visual and noise disturbance, fire, invasive species, effects of predatory pets etc." (Document D). Sure, going through with the idea of rewilding isn't going to be an entire, shall I say, "walk in the park." However, the benefits in the end will outweigh the difficulties along the way, and the goal of restoring nature will have one more task ticked off the list. When taking the time to look, the statistics are right before one's eyes. Sarah Fastnacht provides the numbers, and they are promising. Going through with rewilding will result in "more than 70% projected extinctions of plants and animals [being] counteracted by restoring only 30% of priority areas" (Document A). Although there is hard work and brain power to be put in, even a little can go a long way.
The rewilding process is one that is worthwhile, and a concept that should be strongly considered. Without innovative ideas and change, society is always going to be wishing for a more ecological friendly world, rather than living in one.

Note: The response uses specific evidence from Sources B and C to support its line of reasoning, as in paragraph 2: “Writers Jepson, Paul, and Frans Schepers argue that the process ‘reflects innovation and creates the possibility for a common, but differentiated (situated) mode of conservation’ (Document B).” However, the commentary following this evidence—“Saving as much wildlife as possible is a consistent motive in today’s society. In this case, the fresh concept of rewilding will do more good than harm, if anything at all”—implies this source citation is self-evident and therefore does not integrate it well into the line of reasoning.
