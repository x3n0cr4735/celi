When you think about the world you live in, it's easy to overlook the problems that are happening on an every day basis. Urban communities are often at a decline of success because of the way people live today. Which is becoming different from previous years. Rewilding initiatives are something that will have a positive impact on communities. It is something that should be done in order to help the environment around your community. This is easy to see and understand, as you learn more about this topic/issue.
Extinctions of plants and animals, air pollution, big amounts of carbon dioxide and "WHO" limits are all valid reasons as to why rewilding cities would be a positive thing. The blog post published by an architecture and design company that specializes in sustainability in document A shows this idea very clearly. Document A draws out the fact that extinctions of plants and animals and 465 billion tons of carbon dioxide, would simply be sequestered by "restoring only 30% or priority areas" (document A). It's easy to overlook these simple problems because they aren't something we think or worry about on a daily basis. It's important to see images such as this one to get a good understanding about what is actually happening today.
Rewilding is a big concept but easily understandable. It's a powerful term however with the right information, it's easy to learn about. Rewilding "Combines a sense of passion and feeling for nature with advances in ecological science" (document B). Rewilding nature is important for society as a whole. Those who are passionate about nature, and always wanting the best for the environment are usually the ones who are committed to something like this. Rewilding communities is definitely something that will take a lot of time and effort. But it is something that is worth being done. It's worth the stress, and the work. The outcome that will occur after this is done, is something that will make people feel accomplished, even if it's just in the smallest bit. Document B shows this in a really well written way.
Rewilding in urban communities is an attempt to better people's way of living. Some people are against rewilding. They don't want to do the work, they don't feel there is a problem, or they simply just don't care. I can understand why some people might feel "urban rewilding" is pointless. If people don't spend time outside. If they don't see for themselves the issues, then why would they care about helping ( document C). Dr. Scott in document C suggests that "urban rewilding in our cities and towns is what's needed to head off this crisis" (document C). Reintroducing better ways of living is important because it allows people the live happier lives. To live in places they feel benefits them. More people than not think that rewilding is a positive thing, and that is something that is important when helping our society.
Urban rewilding is worth the work as it is the only thing that will successfully improve the way people live. Also, if urban rewilding is done right, cities could become places where nature is welcome (document C). People should learn more about this, so in reality, it can actually be done.
