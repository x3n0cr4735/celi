Rewilding is a term that not many people have heard of or even pay attention to. That doesn't mean it's not important either. Rewilding is a good thing for the planet, it's good for plants and the environment. The world needs to start caring and the children espcially, children are the future.
Rewilding is good for our environment and for the future of perserving our world. In source C " If people don't spend any time outside, why are they going to care about their local places let alone the national parks in the distance." Going outside isn't just good for the planet, but it is also good for yourself. Nature isn't really welcome in big cities but reintroducing new plants can make it feel like it is welcome. Kids need to start caring about nature and not just about phones and video games. It gives you a different way to see our planet and care about what happens to it.
In addition rewilding is valuable in our society to learn as a whole. In source B "Rewilding is exciting, engaging and challenging: it is promoting debate and deliberation on what is natural and the natures we collectively wish to conserve and shape." It's important for kids to understand and a challenge can be what a lot of children need. Also In source A " More then 70% projected extinctions of plants and animals would be counteracted by restoring only 30% of priority areas." That can be such a good thing and that's why rewilding especially for our country is important. If we don't we could loose 70% of plants and animals, that would send the ecosystem into whack.
Overall Rewilding should be focused on more, we have a lot to lose. Putting in the time and effort in our cities and urban settings is what we need to do. If you don't care now, start caring, kids especially need to focus in.
