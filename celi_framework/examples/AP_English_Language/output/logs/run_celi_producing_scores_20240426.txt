You are a professional test taker AI agent. You have the ability to call outside functions.


I am going to give you step by step instructions on how to draft a free response to a test question.
Below you will find a json object that contains the index of test questions that need to be responded to.
The keys of the json are the questions numbers (q1, q2, q3) of the free response section of a test. The values are the respective topics.


Free response test sections to be responded to:
{'q1': 'Urban Rewilding', 'q2': 'Michelle Obama Speech', 'q3': 'Community of Voices'}


We will look at a completed example free response test section that is similar to the test to be worked on.
Its full content can be queried with a function (example_question_text_getter) and used as an example (in json format).
The keys of the json are the question numbers (q1, q2, q3) of the free response test section and the values contain the questions and answers.
Question n of the examples lines up with question n in the test section being worked on.

**Note:** You may begin writing your response before the reading period is over.

(This question counts as one-third of the total essay section score.)

Urban rewilding is an effort to restore natural ecological processes and habitats in city environments. Many cities around the world have embraced rewilding as part of larger movements to promote ecological conservation and environmentally friendly design. Now, a movement to promote urban rewilding is beginning to take shape in the United States as well.

Carefully read the six sources, including the introductory information for each source. Write an essay that synthesizes material from at least three of the sources and develops your position on the extent to which rewilding initiatives are worthwhile for urban communities to pursue.

- Source A (infographic from Fastnacht)
- Source B (Jepson and Schepers policy brief)
- Source C (NRPA article)
- Source D (Garland article)
- Source E (graph from McDonald et al.)
- Source F (Chatterton book excerpt)

In your response you should do the following:
- Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position.
- Select and use evidence from at least three of the provided sources to support your line of reasoning.
- Indicate clearly the sources used through direct quotation, paraphrase, or summary.
- Sources may be cited as Source A, Source B, etc., or by using the description in parentheses.
- Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.
- Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.

### Source A

Fastnacht, Sarah. “The Necessity of Rewilding our Cities.” Makers of Sustainable Spaces, MOSS, 29 Apr. 2021, moss.amsterdam/2021/04/29/rewilding-our-cities.

The following infographic is based on an image in a blog post published by an architecture and design company that specializes in sustainability.

**-- START of Infographic Description --**
The infographic displays several key statistics emphasizing the environmental benefits of urban rewilding:
- A silhouette representation of various animals, ranging from large to small, stands against a backdrop of trees, symbolizing diverse wildlife.
- A prominent statistic states that "More than 70% of projected extinctions of plants and animals would be counteracted by restoring only 30% of priority areas."
- Below this, the figure "465 billion tons of carbon dioxide" is highlighted, which would be sequestered by restoring 30% of priority ecological areas.
- The lower section of the infographic illustrates factory chimneys with smoke plumes, with a caption explaining that "More than 80% of people living in urban areas that monitor air pollution are exposed to air quality levels that exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) limits."
**-- END of Infographic Description --**

Note: Priority areas refers to ecosystems identified by researchers as particularly important for biodiversity. Sequestration is the capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere so that it does not contribute to global climate change.

Rewilding is a powerful new term in conservation. This may be because it combines a sense of passion and
feeling for nature with advances in ecological science. The term resonates with diverse publics and seems to
have particular appeal to a younger urban generation and among those who want a voice in shaping a new rural
environment. Rewilding is exciting, engaging and challenging: it is promoting debate and deliberation on what
is natural and the natures we collectively wish to conserve and shape.
Rewilding is a multifaceted concept with three broad dimensions that interact with each other: 1) restoring and
giving space to natural processes, 2) reconnecting wild(er) nature with the modern economy, and 3) responding
to and shaping cosmopolitan perceptions of nature conservation among European society. The following
principles are coming to characterise and guide rewilding as a distinct approach to conservation.
1. Restoring natural processes and ecological dynamics—both abiotic such as river flows, and biotic such as
the ecological web and food-chain—through reassembling lost guilds<sup>1</sup> of animals in dynamic landscapes.
2. A gradated and situated approach, where the goal is to move up a scale of wildness within the constraints
of what is possible, and interacting with local cultural identities.
3. Taking inspiration from the past but not replicating it. Developing new natural heritage and value that
evokes the past but shapes the future.
4. Creating self-sustaining, resilient ecosystems (including re-connecting habitats and species populations
within the wider landscapes) that provide resilience to external threats and pressures, including the impact of
climate change (adaptation).
5. Working towards the ideal of passive management, where once restored, we step back and allow dynamic
natural processes to shape conservation outcomes.
6. Creating new natural assets that connect with modern society and economy and promote innovation,
enterprise and investment in and around natural areas, leading to new nature-inspired economies.
7. Reconnecting policy with popular conservation sentiment and a recognition that conservation is a
culturally dynamic as well as a scientific and technical pursuit.
As a new conservation frame, rewilding brings together established and newer conservation worldviews. People
are combining these in different ways creating different ‘shades’ of rewilding, many of which have labels. This
is a limitation and opportunity. On the one hand it exposes rewilding to sensationalists media interpretations
and charges of a lack of clarity, consensus and evidence by groups within conservation science. On the other
hand it reflects innovation and creates the possibility for a common, but differentiated (situated) mode of
conservation: one that is guided by a set of principles that member states or regions can interpret in ways suited
to their nature conservation traditions, landscapes, culture and economies.

"Urban Rewilding." Parks and Recreation, National Recreation and Park Association, 1 Nov. 2016, nrpa.org/parks-recreation-magazine/2016/november/urban-rewilding/.

The following is excerpted from an article in a magazine published by a nonprofit organization that promotes
parks and environmental conservation.
“Close your eyes for a moment and picture a place from childhood that’s extremely meaningful,” directed
Opening Session keynote speaker Dr. Scott Sampson. “Imagine what it looks like, feels like, who you’re there
with, what the smells are.”
By an almost unanimous show of hands, Dr. Scott, host and science advisor of the Emmy-nominated PBS
KIDS television series “Dinosaur Train” and author of How to Raise a Wild Child: The Art and Science of
Falling in Love with Nature, illustrated how, for a large number in the audience, that extremely meaningful
childhood place involves the outdoors. The audience largely consisted of Baby Boomers/Generation Xers who
remember enjoying abundant, unstructured outdoor playtime as kids. For many of today’s youth, those
childhood places will look much different.…
Imagine 25 years from now, he posits, how many hands would be raised in response to the same question about
a meaningful childhood place involving the outdoors. “If people don’t spend any time outside, why are they
going to care about their local places let alone the national parks in the distance,” he asked.
Dr. Scott suggests that “urban rewilding” in our cities and towns is what’s needed to head off this crisis.
Rewilding is a term usually used in connection with reintroducing an apex predator into an ecosystem in an
attempt to restore balance. A familiar example of this top-down approach to restoring balance would be the
efforts to return wolves to Yellowstone Park. Urban rewilding is a bottom up approach that starts with the
simple act of planting mostly native plants. They are critical to attracting native insects, which in turn attract
birds and various animals back to the local ecosystem. And, if we do urban rewilding right, cities could become
places where nature is welcome. And once that happens, we need to help children develop NEW eyes to see
nature: to notice it, engage with it—play is an important way for kids to engage with nature and it also allows
them to gain some experience with risk-taking, while developing a sense of wonder about it.
This movement to “rewild” or “wild” children touches on all three NRPA Pillars—Conservation, Health and
Wellness and Social Equity. However, it’s a movement that requires big thinking about what we want the future
to look like and for each community that future will look different. It also will require deep collaboration
among multiple organizations that bring their various areas of expertise, each doing their part to achieve the end
goal of successful, thriving communities. “We’re at a juncture where the decisions we and the next generation
make will determine the course of this planet for thousands of years to come,” Dr. Scott noted. He then
challenged us to go out into our communities and think about what those collaborations could be, look like and
grow into, and to think big because “that’s where success resides.”

The following is excerpted from an online discussion of urban rewilding in the United Kingdom hosted by a
nonprofit organization that publishes research and writing about cities. The author is the associate director of an
environmental consultancy.
There are certainly opportunities for introducing re-wilding in rural parts of the UK, in particular in upland
regions where, without subsidy, agriculture is economically unviable for the most part. With respect to the UK’s
cities, nature should also be allowed to take its own path in certain select locations to create some semblance of
wildness. I am unconvinced however that re-wilding is the appropriate terminology or the approach to wildlife
restoration that we should be pursuing in UK cities at any meaningful scale.
The large expanses of greenspace that would be required to recreate fully functioning wildwood, including
relatively large numbers of herbivores and viable populations of naturally scarce predators at the top of food
chain, are simply not available in our cities, where space is increasingly at a premium. Sustainable urban design
should be seeking to avoid low-density sprawl and instead promote compact, transit-oriented,
pedestrian-and-bicycle friendly urban development that provides easy access to services. This development
model is crucial for tackling congestion and for reducing CO2 and other harmful emissions. Given this compact
city imperative, the proposition of devoting large areas of urban space for re-wilding in anything approaching
its true sense is untenable.…
Some authors/practitioners respond that there should be no minimum area thresholds for wilderness and
re-wilding from an ecological perspective, frequently quoting Aldo Leopold who declared that “no tract of
land is too small for the wilderness idea”. While it is true that ecosystems can be considered at the
microcosm, there really is not the space available to recreate complex self-sustaining food webs, with
meaningful ranges of predators and prey, in accordance with the true principles of re-wilding.
Even ignoring the seeming disregard for matters relating to population viability analysis and the principles of
island biogeography, other concerns remain. In those small areas where nature can be left to its own devices,
many people may have a profound dislike for the outcome that sometimes emerges. Negative comments may be
expressed relating to perceptions of safety, the appearance of neglect, reduced accessibility and visual/aesthetic
preference. With respect to the last of these concerns, while education programmes can attune people’s
valuation patterns, within an urban context a great many people will continue to favour more ordered,
manicured environments. Undeniably, a previously accessible urban greenspace that has been left to nature,
which then rapidly succeeds into a monoculture of impenetrable bramble or butterfly-bush, is unlikely to be
well-received by most local residents.…
The disturbed nature of urban soils is likely to be another major limiting factor, impoverished as they frequently
are in terms of seedbank, organic material and soil organisms. Without active management newly emerging
urban woodland would also be subject to degradation by trampling, visual and noise disturbance, fire, invasive
species, effects of predatory pets etc. To reiterate, unencumbered natural succession may well produce
landscapes in urban areas dramatically less visually and ecologically appealing than anticipated.

The following is based on a graph published in a community-focused academic journal dedicated to advancing
environmental sustainability. It shows responses from a survey conducted in three towns in the United Kingdom.

--- START OF GRAPH DESCRIPTION ---

The graph presents a bar chart depicting the relationship between neighborhood forest cover as a percentage and the mental health of urban dwellers, represented in percentage terms. Five categories of forest cover are displayed on the x-axis: less than 10%, 10-15%, 15-20%, 20-25%, 25-30%, and greater than 30%. The y-axis represents the percentage of urban dwellers, scaled from 0 to 40%.

The tallest bar corresponds to neighborhoods with less than 10% forest cover, indicating the highest percentage of urban dwellers with mental health issues. As forest cover increases, there is a marked decline in the percentage of people reporting mental health issues. Notably, a significant reduction in depression, stress, and anxiety is observed in areas with higher levels of forest cover.

In neighborhoods with 20-25% forest cover, there is a reported 50% decrease in depression and 43% decrease in stress. Areas with more than 30% forest cover see a further reduction, with a notable 56% decrease in anxiety levels. The data suggests a correlation between increased urban forest cover and improved mental health among residents.

dwellers who live in neighborhoods with varying levels of forest cover.

Chatterton, Paul. Unlocking Sustainable Cities: A Manifesto for Real Change. Pluto Press, 2019.

The following is an excerpt from a book exploring the benefits of urban rewilding.
We are beginning to see a proliferation of hybrid natural and built forms through, for example, living walls,
rooftop farms, vertical or sky gardens and breathing buildings. These can have significant beneficial effects. For
example, urban street canyons refer to the effect created by high buildings lining a street, which can become
hotspots for harmful pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. A study by Thomas Pugh and
colleagues from the Lancaster Environment Centre suggests that strategic placement of vegetation in street
canyons can cut air pollution by up to 30 per cent. They can also stop urban overheating and provide effective
insulation and shading for buildings, as well as reducing noise pollution. And of course, there are the
psychological and aesthetic benefits of being proximate to an abundance of natural greenery.
Green corridors and linear parks can be retrofitted into the existing city. For example, the High Line project in
New York transformed an old rail line into a nearly two-mile urban park. It opened in 2014 and became a short
cut for walkers and one of the city’s favourite parks featuring art installations and places for hanging out. Other
cities are following suit including Chicago’s 606 Park and Toronto’s Bentway, which has slotted 55 outdoor
rooms under its Gardiner Expressway featuring farmers’ markets, performance spaces and a children’s garden.
Miami is also building the Underline, a nine-mile linear park underneath its metrorail line. In my own city of
Leeds, a community group is attempting to do the same thing on one of Leeds’ abandoned Victorian train
viaducts. The Madrid Rio project was one of the most exciting urban reclamation projects in Europe—burying
a former ring road to create over 600 hectares of parkland. Efforts are being made not just to create
greenspaces, but to create interconnected green corridors. For example, the All London Green Grid (ALGG) is
the green infrastructure strategy for London, which sets out a vision to create an interconnected network of
green and blue spaces across the entire city. It is this interconnection that is so important in terms of creating
space for biodiversity to move more extensively.
Singapore is one of the pioneers of placing nature at the heart of its planning and urban design process. As a
self-labelled garden city, it now prefers to call itself ‘the city in a garden’. To realize this vision of living in an
urban park, Singapore implemented a landscape replacement policy whereby any greenery removed during
construction has to be reinstated as part of the development. It is estimated that the amount of urban greenery
has been at least doubled, but mainly through sky gardens. The city has also built nearly 300km of park
connectors to create deeper connections between parks and neighbourhoods.

Bowery, the largest vertical-farming company in the United States, manipulates light, humidity, temperature and other conditions to grow produce, bankrolled by investors like Justin Timberlake, Natalie Portman, and the chefs José Andrés and Tom Colicchio.
“Once I tasted the arugula, I was sold,” said Mr. Colicchio, who for years rolled his eyes at people who claimed to grow delicious hydroponic produce. “It was so spicy and so vibrant, it just blew me away.”
The two operations are part of a new generation of hydroponic farms that create precise growing conditions using technological advances like machine-learning algorithms, data analytics and proprietary software systems to coax customized flavors and textures from fruits and vegetables. And they can do it almost anywhere.
These farms arrive at a pivotal moment, as swaths of the country wither in the heat and drought of climate change, abetted in part by certain forms of agriculture. The demand for locally grown food has never been stronger, and the pandemic has shown many people that the food supply chain isn’t as resilient as they thought. . . .
“We’ve perfected mother nature indoors through that perfect combination of science and technology married with farming,” said Daniel Malechuk, the chief executive of Kalera, a company that sells whole lettuces, with the roots intact, in plastic clamshells for about the same price as other prewashed lettuce. In March, the company opened a 77,000-square-foot facility south of Atlanta that can produce more than 10 million heads of lettuce a year. . . .
Although the nutritional profile of hydroponic produce continues to improve, no one yet knows what kind of long-term health impact fruits and vegetables grown without soil will have. No matter how many nutrients indoor farmers put into the water, critics insist that indoor farms can never match the taste and nutritional value, or provide the environmental advantages, that come from the marriage of sun, a healthy soil microbiome and plant biology found on well-run organic farms.
“What will the health outcomes be in two generations?” Mr. Chapman [Dave Chapman, a Vermont farmer and the executive director of the Real Organic Project] asked. “It’s a huge live experiment, and we are the rats.”

Interview by Georgia Jiang. “Vertical Farming—No Longer a Futuristic Concept.” Under the Microscope: Zooming in on Agriculture’s Biggest Challenges, Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture, 27 Jan. 2022, [www.ars.usda.gov/oc/utm/vertical-farming-no-longer-a-futuristic-concept](https://www.ars.usda.gov/oc/utm/vertical-farming-no-longer-a-futuristic-concept).

The following is excerpted from an interview with Kai-Shu Ling, a research plant pathologist, and James Altland, a research horticulturalist. The interview is one of the “Under the Microscope” series of monthly interviews published online by the Agricultural Research Service [ARS] of the United States Department of Agriculture [USDA].
UM [Under the Microscope Interviewer]—What are the advantages of vertical farming?
KL [Kai-Shu Ling]: Vertical farming offers many benefits that traditional farming cannot. For example, while the crops produced by traditional farming are limited by geographic region and seasonal changes, vertical farming allows growers to grow regional or seasonal crops indoors year-round. They can grow crops anywhere a greenhouse or controlled environment can be established. As a result, consumers (especially those in urban areas typically far from traditional farmlands) can also have easier access to fresher produce.
We’re currently repurposing ship containers to become vertical farming research units. Although vertical farming’s high costs can often be discouraging, shipping containers and abandoned warehouses are readily available and relatively inexpensive. Converting them into vertical farming environments not only breathes life back into discarded infrastructure but also puts fresh produce in parking lots and urban centers.
JA [James Altland]: Vertical farming also uses much less land. For some crops, 10 to 20 times the yield can be obtained per acre in vertical farming compared to open-field crops. Other advantages are that vertical farms are in enclosed structures, so not subject to extreme or inclement weather. Vertical farms are being built in deserts, high-population urban areas, and other places that traditional open-field farming is not practical.
UM—What are the limitations to this type of farming? What is ARS doing to overcome these challenges?
JA: The major disadvantage is that you give up access to the Sun, which is [the] most abundant (and free) source of energy on Earth. Growing plants vertically in stacked systems often requires artificial light sources, which can become costly. Vertical farming also requires humidity control through expensive and energy-intensive heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.
UM—What crops are best grown through vertical farming? Which crops are better suited for traditional farming?
JA: Currently, lettuce and other leafy greens are the most popular crops for vertical farming. While research is underway to grow all types of crops in vertical farms, the most successful ones today would be those that can be grown hydroponically, have relatively short compact growth forms, and can be harvested in their entirety. For example, lettuce can be harvested in its whole form, as opposed to corn where only the cob is harvested for sale and the rest must be disposed of some other way.
KL: We’re currently investigating the vertical farming potential of small fruits (e.g., strawberries) and fruiting vegetables (e.g., tomato, pepper). Cereal and row crops (e.g., corn, rice, wheat and soybeans) are still better suited for traditional farming.
UM—I understand that vertical farming has launched into space. What are you hoping to accomplish with this effort?
JA: NASA is keenly interested in CEA [controlled environment agriculture] for its use on long-term manned space missions.
KL: Agreed. NASA is a pioneer in research on crop production under controlled environment. NASA continues to improve the technologies for growing vegetables and fruits in space for future Moon and Mars explorations. USDA has a long history of collaboration with NASA on controlled environment agriculture research.

The following is excerpted from an article published online by an environmental scientist and sustainability expert.
[T]here are costs to these [vertical] farms. Huge costs.
First, these systems are really expensive to build. The shipping container systems developed by [container farming technology company] Freight Farms, for example, cost between $82,000 and $85,000 per container—an astonishing sum for a box that just grows greens and herbs. Just one container costs as much as 10 entire acres of prime American farmland—which is a far better investment, both in terms of food production and future economic value. Just remember: farmland has the benefit of generally appreciating in value over time, whereas a big metal box is likely to only decrease in value.
Second, food produced this way is very expensive. For example, the Wall Street Journal reports that mini-lettuces grown by Green Line Growers cost more than twice as much as organic lettuce available in most stores. And this is typical for other indoor growers around the country: it’s very, very expensive, even compared to organic food. Instead of making food more available, especially to poorer families on limited budgets, these indoor crops are only available to the affluent. It might be fine for gourmet lettuce, or fancy greens for expensive restaurants, but regular folks may find it out of reach.
Finally, indoor farms use a lot of energy and materials to operate. The container farms from Freight Farms, for example, use about 80 kilowatt-hours of electricity a day to power the lights and pumps. That’s nearly 2–3 times as much electricity as a typical (and still very inefficient) American home, or about 8 times the electricity used by an average San Francisco apartment. And on the average American electrical grid, this translates to emitting 44,000 pounds of CO2 per container per year, from electricity alone, not counting any additional heating costs. This is vastly more than the emissions it would take to ship the food from someplace else. And none of it is necessary.
But, Wait, Can’t Indoor Farms Use Renewable Energy?
Proponents of indoor techno-farms often say that they can offset the enormous sums of electricity they use, by powering them with renewable energy—especially solar panels—to make the whole thing carbon neutral.
But just stop and think about this for a second.
These indoor “farms” would use solar panels to harvest naturally occurring sunlight, and convert it into electricity, so that they can power . . . artificial sunlight? In other words, they’re trying to use the sun to replace the sun.
But we don’t need to replace the sun. Of all of the things we should worry about in agriculture, the availability of free sunlight is not one of them. Any system that seeks to replace the sun to grow food is probably a bad idea.

The following is excerpted from a research article in an online interdisciplinary journal that focuses on sustainability-related topics.
The vertical farming model was proposed with the aim of increasing the amount of agricultural land by ‘building upwards.’ In other words, the effective arable<sup>1</sup> area for crops can be increased by constructing a high-rise building with many levels on the same footprint of land (Despommier 2010; The Economist 2010).
One approach is to employ a single tall glasshouse design with many racks of crops stacked vertically. It is an extension of the greenhouse hydroponic farming model and addresses problems relating to the use of soils, such as the requirement for herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers. . . .

**Clean, green, and gourmet (CGG) food**
The possibility of CGG food production is easily the most attractive feature of the vertical farming model. This aspect is less price sensitive to affluent consumers in high-demand countries such as China. All-year-round crop production without seasonality, in a climate-controlled environment (including both temperature and humidity), will produce fresh produce virtually on demand. There would be no weather-related crop failures due to drought or flooding if hydroponic and aeroponic technologies are employed.
Using recycled water and nutrients in a closed, indoor, climate-controlled environment adds to food security and can reduce or even completely eliminate the need for pesticides and herbicides. Contamination by pathogens or heavy metals will no longer be an issue as occurs in rural farming. There is scope for marketing the product in this respect. Strict hygienic practices must still be observed to minimize the risk of introduction of pathogens and biological contamination into the growing space. However, in a vertical farming situation, one can closely monitor the crop for signs of pest or disease both manually and automatically using sensing technologies. This mode of cultivation is very well suited to adopting new and emerging robotic technologies as well as remote-sensing procedures. This means that outbreaks are detected early to enable diseased and infested plants to be identified and disposed of appropriately. Any residual contamination can be cleaned up when the crop is harvested using strict hygienic practices.
One possible obstacle to vertical farming is that some consumers may regard the products as ‘Frankenfoods,’ as discovered by managers of a giant underground farm supplying London’s restaurants (Curtis 2016) and another business that supplies between 8% and 12% of the British output of tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers (Fletcher 2013). For this reason, some enterprises may not publicize growing conditions for fear of alienating consumers and destabilizing sales potential. To minimize this issue, it can be stressed that growing conditions are not different from existing hydroponic facilities with respect to germplasm<sup>2</sup>, nutrition, and other cultural and production practices. Furthermore, the plants are derived from natural breeding programs with normal nutrients supplied. There is an advantage that plants are grown in a hygienic environment with reduced need for pesticides and are in a closed system so there is no environmental pollution from nitrogen leaching or run-off.

The following is adapted from a graphic published in a book about vertical farming.

[START INFOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION]

This infographic is presented in two side-by-side panels, with the left panel labeled "2010" and the right panel labeled "2050".

In the 2010 panel, there is an image of the continent of South America with an arrow pointing downwards to a row of six black silhouetted figures representing the global population. Underneath, it reads "World Population: 6.8 billion". The text below states that 80% of the total arable land on Earth is currently used for the production of food, which is equivalent in size to the continent of South America.

The 2050 panel features the image of South America again, with an additional smaller land mass resembling the shape of Brazil, indicating an increase in land needed to feed the population. The same downward arrow points to a row of nine silhouetted figures, three of which are lighter in color, signifying an addition to the population. Below, the text reads "Projected World Population: 9.5 billion". The accompanying text explains that an area the size of Brazil is required to feed an additional 2.7 billion people. It emphasizes that this amount of arable land is simply not available.

RESPONSE:
While many would like to believe that vertical farms are the future of produce due to their adaptability and modernity, in reality those systems are overvalued and only necessary for very niche applications. Vertical farms are greenhouses where produce is grown stacked in rows without the use of soil, and with complex technology that emulates the perfect growing conditions for said product.

This sounds like a great idea, in practice, fresh produce year-round grown efficiently, the reality is very different. Vertical farms are expensive – both in initial and operating costs. Source C reveals that vertical farms have extremely high initial investment per unit land area compared to fields, greenhouses, and hydroponic systems and Source D gives us the exact cost of over eighty thousand dollars per container from industry leader Freight Farms. With an initial investment so large, it would easily be more profitable and efficient to simply buy land to cultivate. These costs alone make it unreasonable to implement in low income areas where access to local produce is needed the most. Until vertical farms can decrease costs to build and operate they are simply out of reach for most communities. Operating cost will most likely struggle to lower. Because there is no soil or sunlight, a large amount of power is required to support these crops – which is strange because the sun is not a competitive resource or non-renewable. These costs are simply unnecessary and create problems other methods have solutions to.

The vertical farm has seen initial success despite its disadvantages when compared to other systems because of its gimmicky marketing. Brand owners have marketed vertical farms as a pseudo-eco-friendly and high-tech food of the future. Source A, a New York Times article marketing vertical farm produce, goes into depth on the famous people investing in vertical farming, dropping names like Justin Timberlake and Natalie Portman to build hype. What does do R&B singers and actors know about the efficacy of modern farming? Little to nothing. That didn't stop the Times from including celebrity testimonials. The food produced using vertical farming is marketed to the upper-class people (who would consider the option of Natalie Portman in their grocery shopping) because they are the only ones who can afford it. Source D again provides numbers, showing products like the lettuce from Green Line Growers costs more than double the market price of organic lettuce. Vertical farms should not be taken seriously as the future of agriculture especially when it brands itself as the new fresh food fad for the wealthy. We can support and modernize agriculture with better distribution of resources to low income communities and by working to eliminate food waste which could also be given to people in need. We already have the production and resources to support our population as long as we allocate those resources effectively.

**Introduction:**
Urban environments, often characterized by concrete jungles and bustling streets, are increasingly becoming the focal points for innovative ecological restoration efforts known as urban rewilding. This initiative aims to reintroduce natural habitats and processes into city landscapes, fostering biodiversity and enhancing the quality of life for urban residents. Urban rewilding is not merely a trend but a necessary evolution towards sustainable urban living, offering profound environmental, social, and economic benefits. This essay argues that urban rewilding initiatives are not only worthwhile but essential for urban communities to pursue, given their potential to significantly contribute to the sustainability and resilience of urban areas.

**Body Section 1: Environmental Benefits**
Urban rewilding presents a unique opportunity to address some of the most pressing environmental challenges faced by urban areas today. According to Source A, an infographic from Fastnacht highlights the critical environmental benefits of urban rewilding, such as the potential to counteract projected extinctions of plants and animals and sequester substantial amounts of carbon dioxide. By restoring priority ecological areas within urban settings, rewilding initiatives can significantly contribute to biodiversity enhancement and climate change mitigation. These efforts not only improve urban air quality but also create green spaces that serve as vital lungs for cities, underscoring the environmental imperative of urban rewilding.

**Body Section 2: Societal Appeal and Engagement**
The appeal of urban rewilding extends beyond its environmental benefits, resonating deeply with diverse urban populations. Source B, a policy brief by Jepson and Schepers, emphasizes rewilding's ability to engage younger generations and urban dwellers who yearn for a connection with nature. This societal engagement is crucial for the success of environmental conservation efforts, as it fosters a sense of stewardship and responsibility towards urban natural spaces. By involving communities in rewilding projects, cities can cultivate a culture of ecological awareness and appreciation, further reinforcing the social fabric and enhancing the well-being of urban residents.

**Body Section 3: Practical Considerations and Implementation**
Implementing urban rewilding initiatives requires careful consideration of practical challenges and opportunities. Source C, an article from the National Recreation and Park Association, discusses the bottom-up approach of urban rewilding, starting with simple acts like planting native plants to attract wildlife. This approach highlights the feasibility of rewilding projects in urban areas, even with space and resource limitations. By leveraging community involvement and innovative design, urban rewilding can transform underutilized spaces into vibrant ecosystems, demonstrating the practicality and transformative potential of these initiatives.

**Conclusion:**
Urban rewilding stands at the forefront of reimagining and revitalizing urban environments. Through its environmental, social, and practical benefits, rewilding initiatives offer a pathway towards more sustainable, resilient, and livable cities. This essay has argued that the pursuit of urban rewilding is not only worthwhile but essential, highlighting its role in addressing ecological challenges, fostering community engagement, and implementing practical solutions. As urban areas continue to grow, the importance of integrating natural processes and habitats into the urban fabric becomes increasingly clear. Urban rewilding represents a hopeful vision for the future, one where cities and nature coexist in harmony, enriching the lives of urban communities and the planet as a whole.

Implementing urban rewilding initiatives requires careful consideration of practical challenges and opportunities. Source C, an article from the National Recreation and Park Association, discusses the bottom-up approach of urban rewilding, starting with simple acts like planting native plants to attract wildlife. This approach highlights the feasibility of rewilding projects in urban areas, even with space and resource limitations. By leveraging community involvement and innovative design, urban rewilding can transform underutilized spaces into vibrant ecosystems, demonstrating the practicality and transformative potential of these initiatives.

Urban rewilding stands at the forefront of reimagining and revitalizing urban environments. Through its environmental, social, and practical benefits, rewilding initiatives offer a pathway towards more sustainable, resilient, and livable cities. This essay has argued that the pursuit of urban rewilding is not only worthwhile but essential, highlighting its role in addressing ecological challenges, fostering community engagement, and implementing practical solutions. As urban areas continue to grow, the importance of integrating natural processes and habitats into the urban fabric becomes increasingly clear. Urban rewilding represents a hopeful vision for the future, one where cities and nature coexist in harmony, enriching the lives of urban communities and the planet as a whole.

RESPONSE:
While many would like to believe that vertical farms are the future of produce due to their adaptability and modernity, in reality those systems are overvalued and only necessary for very niche applications. Vertical farms are greenhouses where produce is grown stacked in rows without the use of soil, and with complex technology that emulates the perfect growing conditions for said product.

This sounds like a great idea, in practice, fresh produce year-round grown efficiently, the reality is very different. Vertical farms are expensive – both in initial and operating costs. Source C reveals that vertical farms have extremely high initial investment per unit land area compared to fields, greenhouses, and hydroponic systems and Source D gives us the exact cost of over eighty thousand dollars per container from industry leader Freight Farms. With an initial investment so large, it would easily be more profitable and efficient to simply buy land to cultivate. These costs alone make it unreasonable to implement in low income areas where access to local produce is needed the most. Until vertical farms can decrease costs to build and operate they are simply out of reach for most communities. Operating cost will most likely struggle to lower. Because there is no soil or sunlight, a large amount of power is required to support these crops – which is strange because the sun is not a competitive resource or non-renewable. These costs are simply unnecessary and create problems other methods have solutions to.

The vertical farm has seen initial success despite its disadvantages when compared to other systems because of its gimmicky marketing. Brand owners have marketed vertical farms as a pseudo-eco-friendly and high-tech food of the future. Source A, a New York Times article marketing vertical farm produce, goes into depth on the famous people investing in vertical farming, dropping names like Justin Timberlake and Natalie Portman to build hype. What does do R&B singers and actors know about the efficacy of modern farming? Little to nothing. That didn't stop the Times from including celebrity testimonials. The food produced using vertical farming is marketed to the upper-class people (who would consider the option of Natalie Portman in their grocery shopping) because they are the only ones who can afford it. Source D again provides numbers, showing products like the lettuce from Green Line Growers costs more than double the market price of organic lettuce. Vertical farms should not be taken seriously as the future of agriculture especially when it brands itself as the new fresh food fad for the wealthy. We can support and modernize agriculture with better distribution of resources to low income communities and by working to eliminate food waste which could also be given to people in need. We already have the production and resources to support our population as long as we allocate those resources effectively.

### Question 2

Suggested time—40 minutes
(This question counts as one-third of the total essay section score.)

Michelle Obama was the First Lady of the United States during the presidential administration of her husband, Barack Obama (2009–2017). During that administration, she led programs including the Reach Higher Initiative, which encourages students to continue their education after high school. One way it does so is by supporting high school counselors’ efforts to get students into college. On January 6, 2017, Obama gave her final speech as First Lady at an event honoring outstanding school counselors. The following passage is an excerpt from that speech. Read the passage carefully. Write an essay that analyzes the rhetorical choices Obama makes to convey her message about her expectations and hope for young people in the United States.

In your response you should do the following:
- Respond to the prompt with a thesis that analyzes the writer’s rhetorical choices.
- Select and use evidence to support your line of reasoning.
- Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.
- Demonstrate an understanding of the rhetorical situation.
- Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.

[A]s I end my time in the White House, I can think
of no better message to send our young people in my
last official remarks as First Lady. So, for all the
Line young people in this room and those who are
watching, know that this country belongs to you—to
all of you, from every background and walk of life. If
you or your parents are immigrants, know that you are
part of a proud American tradition—the infusion of
new cultures, talents and ideas, generation after
generation, that has made us the greatest country on
earth.
If your family doesn’t have much money, I want
you to remember that in this country, plenty of folks,
including me and my husband—we started out with
very little. But with a lot of hard work and a good
education, anything is possible—even becoming
President. That’s what the American Dream is all
about.
If you are a person of faith, know that religious
diversity is a great American tradition, too. In fact,
that’s why people first came to this country—to
worship freely. And whether you are Muslim,
Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh—these religions are
teaching our young people about justice, and
compassion, and honesty. So I want our young people
to continue to learn and practice those values with
pride. You see, our glorious diversity—our diversities
of faiths and colors and creeds—that is not a threat to
who we are, it makes us who we are. So the young
people here and the young people out there: Do not
ever let anyone make you feel like you don’t matter,
or like you don’t have a place in our American
story—because you do. And you have a right to be
exactly who you are.
But I also want to be very clear: This right isn’t just
handed to you. No, this right has to be earned every
single day. You cannot take your freedoms for
granted. Just like generations who have come before
you, you have to do your part to preserve and protect
those freedoms. And that starts right now, when
you’re young.
Right now, you need to be preparing yourself to
add your voice to our national conversation. You need
to prepare yourself to be informed and engaged as a
citizen, to serve and to lead, to stand up for our proud
American values and to honor them in your daily
lives. And that means getting the best education
possible so you can think critically, so you can
express yourself clearly, so you can get a good job
and support yourself and your family, so you can be a
positive force in your communities.
And when you encounter obstacles—because I
guarantee you, you will, and many of you already
have—when you are struggling and you start thinking
about giving up, I want you to remember something
that my husband and I have talked about since we first
started this journey nearly a decade ago, something
that has carried us through every moment in this
White House and every moment of our lives, and that
is the power of hope—the belief that something better
is always possible if you’re willing to work for it and
fight for it.
It is our fundamental belief in the power of hope
that has allowed us to rise above the voices of doubt
and division, of anger and fear that we have faced in
our own lives and in the life of this country. Our hope
that if we work hard enough and believe in ourselves,
then we can be whatever we dream, regardless of the
limitations that others may place on us. The hope that
when people see us for who we truly are, maybe, just
maybe they, too, will be inspired to rise to their best
possible selves.
That is the hope of students like Kyra<sup>1</sup> who fight to
discover their gifts and share them with the world. It’s
the hope of school counselors like Terri<sup>2</sup> and all these
folks up here who guide those students every step of
the way, refusing to give up on even a single young
person. Shoot, it’s the hope of my—folks like my dad
who got up every day to do his job at the city water
plant; the hope that one day, his kids would go to
college and have opportunities he never dreamed of.
That’s the kind of hope that every single one of
us—politicians, parents, preachers—all of us need to
be providing for our young people. Because that is
what moves this country forward every single
day—our hope for the future and the hard work that
hope inspires.

<sup>1</sup>a student who worked with school counselor Terri Tchorzynski
<sup>2</sup>Terri Tchorzynski, the 2017 National School Counselor
of the Year and honoree of the event

RESPONSE:
In her speech, Dove, a renowned poet, employs anecdote, diction, and parallelism in order to advise college graduates on the key values, such as intellectual curiosity, effort, and bravery, that she deems necessary for navigating the world.
Dove's utilization of ambiguous diction instills curiosity and engagement with the patronization of her speech. Through the parallelistic structure of her three main points, Dove shares with the audience of college students that she "wishes you...hunger, hard work, [and] uncertainty" (Dove). Although initially these wishes are interpretable as negatives, their denotation and appear to be ill-omens, Dove explains the figurative meanings which serves to keep the audience attentive. By catching, surprising the audience, Dove is able to clarify her meaning, explaining how when she wished the audience hunger she did not mean physiological want but a continued spiritual and intellectual appetite (Dove). Efforts of rhetoric, like the aforementioned, allow Dove to explain the importance of possessing a desire to learn and take advantage of "following what attracts you" (Dove). This piece of advice seems to inspire students that learning is a continual practice and should actively continue post-usage. Additionally, hard work - Dove explained that "hard work" does not mean back-breaking labor, but instead gaining "an appreciation" for the work that comes before the "big show" (Dove). This strengthens her utilization of diction by creating hard work to mean something that incites a celebrated process, therefore, encouraging people to put effort and enjoy hardships. Similarly, Dove introduced uncertainty to not mean something negative, but instead of comfort because she explains that "sometimes you don't know where you're going" but the only way you'll find out is if you get going (Dove). The quotation illuminates that despite doubts, one individual must be bold to reach out of their comfort zone and grow. Through these ambiguous, multi-faceted words, Dove empowers, inspires her audience to put a twist on and instead possess a more positive outlook on the challenges.
Furthermore, Dove employs her message of the importance and efficiency of her values through personal anecdotes. Dove shares her father's pep talk or at putting "150%" effort into everything one does in order to express his appreciation and impact on both her and her father. As the first African-American research chemist, Dove's father, she understood the importance of hard work and holding oneself accountable. From this, Dove learned the importance of putting in effort and accountability which she shared through telling her own story of how through each stage of her life, from recognizing her voice when "giving class presentations in high school" to being awarded the Pulitzer Prize to being named "Poet Laureate" to joining the "White House celebration" she always used the 150% effort rule. By demonstrating the power of her father's message through both her and her father's stories, Dove not only explains the process but also the effects and impacts gaining her argument credibility.

Note:
AP® English Language and Composition 2023 Scoring Commentary:
Sophistication (0–1 points): 0
Although it consistently identifies and explains rhetorical choices, the response does not display a particularly complex understanding of the rhetorical situation. It acknowledges the relationship of the speaker with the audience but does so in a generalized way, focusing on how Dove’s choices “inspire” listeners or lend her argument “credibility.” Although the response demonstrates effective control of language, it does not demonstrate a consistently persuasive or vivid style.

Next task to complete: Task #3 - Develop response strategy

The example response provided analyzes a speech by Dove, focusing on her use of anecdote, diction, and parallelism to convey key values to college graduates. The response outlines how Dove's ambiguous diction engages the audience, her parallel structure emphasizes her main points, and her personal anecdotes add credibility to her message. This analysis demonstrates a structured approach to dissecting rhetorical strategies, focusing on how specific choices by the speaker support the overarching message.

From this example, it's clear that an effective response should:
1. Clearly identify and explain the rhetorical strategies used by the speaker.
2. Discuss how these strategies engage the audience and support the speaker's message.
3. Use specific examples from the speech to illustrate points.
4. Maintain a clear and organized structure, with a focus on coherence and cohesion throughout the analysis.

This understanding will guide the development of a response strategy for analyzing Michelle Obama's speech, focusing on her rhetorical choices and their impact on conveying her message to the audience.

Based on the insights gained from analyzing the example response, the strategy for developing a response to the prompt on Michelle Obama's speech will focus on identifying and analyzing the rhetorical strategies she employs to convey her message of hope and expectation to young people. The response will be structured around the following key elements:

1. **Introduction**: Begin with an overview of Michelle Obama's position as the First Lady and her commitment to youth and education, leading to the context of her final speech. Introduce the thesis statement that will focus on the rhetorical strategies Obama uses, such as personal anecdotes, inclusive language, and appeals to ethos and pathos, to inspire and motivate young people.

2. **Body Paragraphs**:
   - **Paragraph 1**: Analyze Obama's use of personal anecdotes, drawing from her own life and her husband's experiences to establish credibility (ethos) and build a connection with the audience. Discuss how these anecdotes serve to make her message more relatable and persuasive.
   - **Paragraph 2**: Examine the use of inclusive language and direct address to engage the audience. Highlight how Obama's choice of words fosters a sense of belonging and ownership over the country's future, emphasizing the diversity and potential of the young people.
   - **Paragraph 3**: Discuss Obama's appeals to pathos, particularly through her message of hope and resilience. Analyze how she inspires action and determination among the youth by sharing visions of overcoming obstacles and contributing positively to society.
   - **Paragraph 4**: Consider the structure of Obama's speech and the strategic placement of her arguments. Evaluate how the flow from personal empowerment to collective responsibility enhances the persuasive impact of her message.

3. **Conclusion**: Summarize the key points made in the body paragraphs, reinforcing the thesis statement. Reflect on the significance of Obama's rhetorical choices in shaping the perceptions and actions of young people. Conclude with remarks on the lasting impact of her speech on the audience and its relevance to the broader American values of diversity, opportunity, and community engagement.

This strategy aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Michelle Obama's rhetorical techniques, supported by specific examples from the speech, to demonstrate how they collectively serve to empower and mobilize young people towards active participation in their communities and the nation at large.

PROMPT:
In a 2018 interview about the importance of collaboration, then United States Representative Carlos Curbelo
stated: “If you’re trying to convince someone that they need to get involved in an issue or perhaps change their
thinking on an issue, trying to scare them is not always effective and can actually sow<sup>1</sup> resentment.”
Write an essay that argues your position on the extent to which Curbelo’s claim about persuading others is
valid.

<sup>1</sup>spread

In your response you should do the following:
• Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position.
• Provide evidence to support your line of reasoning.
• Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.
• Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.

RESPONSE:
Fear is a powerful motivator that has been used for both good and ill as long as humans have walked the Earth. As a small child, you're taught to fear fires, storms, and lightning, and to be wary of cars while crossing the street as a safety measure. However, using fear as a method of reasoning or as a means to change minds or incite positive change rarely works. Attempts to persuade others through fear are seldom effective and can even sow resentment, inhibiting positive change from occurring.
When I was younger, my parents tried to scare me into obeying them with threats of privilege removal, time being taken away, or simply being confined to my room. This often didn't work. If anything, their attempts to scare me into doing "the right thing" only made me more determined to do the opposite. Any positive changes I could have made to be safer as a child were fought against solely because I disliked being scared into doing things. I indeed resented my parents for trying to control me through fear, which prevented any good they were trying to achieve from taking root. If reasoning and explanations had been given when what I perceived as completely unfair and often unnecessary rules were told to me, perhaps I would have been more receptive. Instead, the fear instilled in me turned into anger and resentment towards those who tried to change my mind, namely my parents.
The use of fear as a motivator also proved unsuccessful in the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, which began at the close of World War Two. Upon discovering that the United States had nuclear weapons, the Soviets stole the secrets of the technology and created their own in response. This theft and the creation of the most powerful weapons known to man at the time were driven by fear. The fear of nuclear war and massive destruction led to a significant spike in the production of nuclear weapons, which had incited the problem. In addition to the fear of death from nuclear weapons that most Americans experienced at that time, there was also suspicion and resentment towards anything perceived as "red" or communist. The concern that the Soviets would kill Americans with nuclear weapons evolved into resentment, which became another motivating factor behind the increased numbers of nuclear warheads in America. It was not until the 1960s that a slight compromise was reached and levels of fear decreased, leading to more cooperation in the 1970s when the number of nuclear weapons was reduced and controlled. This positive change and involvement in the issue of nuclear weapons wasn't brought about by fear, but by a wish for a better future and a willingness to cooperate with others towards a common goal.
While fear is often seen as a potent motivator that drives people to respond quickly and allows them to be persuaded more easily and quickly, this is not always the case. The use of fear to persuade others seldom leads to genuine positive change or persuasion. It most often causes the opposite, as seen in personal experience and in global affairs, especially regarding the Cold War.

Last task completed successfully: Yes

Currently completing task: Task #2 - Analyze and Understand the Example Response

Next task to complete: Task #3 - Develop response strategy

The example response for a similar question provides a clear structure for constructing an argumentative essay. It begins with a general statement about the nature of fear as a motivator, followed by a personal anecdote to illustrate the ineffectiveness of fear-based persuasion. The response then transitions to a historical example—the Cold War—to further support the thesis that fear is not an effective means of persuasion and can lead to resentment and opposition rather than change. This structure effectively combines personal experience with historical evidence to argue a position on the prompt.

Key strategies and methodologies from the example response that can be applied to the current question on the importance of creating a community of voices include:
1. Starting with a broad statement related to the prompt to introduce the topic.
2. Using a personal anecdote or example to make the argument relatable and to illustrate the main point from a personal perspective.
3. Incorporating a broader, possibly historical, example to provide additional evidence and to show the wider applicability of the argument.
4. Concluding with a summary of the argument and a restatement of the thesis, emphasizing the evidence presented.

These strategies will guide the development of a response strategy for the current question, ensuring a well-structured and persuasive essay.

Based on the insights gained from analyzing the example response, the strategy for responding to the prompt on the importance of creating a community of voices will involve:

1. **Introduction**: Begin with a broad statement about the power of collective action or the historical significance of communities in driving change. Introduce Maxine Hong Kingston's claim as a central thesis that a community of voices is more potent than individual efforts in speaking truths and effecting change.

2. **Thesis Statement**: Clearly state the position that the creation of a community of voices is crucial for amplifying truth and fostering change, providing a more effective platform for advocacy and resistance than individual voices alone.

3. **Body Section 1**: Use a personal anecdote or a contemporary example to illustrate how a community of voices has successfully amplified a cause or truth that individual efforts could not. This could involve movements like Black Lives Matter, environmental advocacy, or digital activism through social media platforms.

4. **Body Section 2**: Incorporate a historical example that demonstrates the long-standing effectiveness of collective action over individual efforts. This could involve civil rights movements, women's suffrage, or international solidarity movements that have led to significant societal changes.

5. **Body Section 3**: Address potential counterarguments, such as instances where individual voices have sparked significant change or the challenges in forming cohesive communities.

### Introduction
Throughout history, the collective power of unified voices has been a driving force for societal transformation and progress. Maxine Hong Kingston's assertion that "a community of voices can speak more truth than individual voices" underscores the profound impact of collective action in advocating for change and justice. This essay argues that the creation of a community of voices is not only beneficial but essential for amplifying truth and fostering societal change, offering a more robust platform for advocacy than individual efforts.

### Thesis Statement
The formation of a community of voices is crucial in achieving a louder, more resonant call for change, providing a foundation for sustained advocacy and the realization of significant societal transformations.

### Body Section 1: Contemporary Example
One vivid example of the power of a community of voices is the global environmental movement. Groups like Extinction Rebellion and the youth-led Fridays for Future have shown how collective action can bring attention to critical issues like climate change. These movements have successfully pressured governments and corporations to acknowledge and act on environmental concerns, demonstrating the significant impact of unified voices over isolated calls for action.

### Body Section 2: Historical Example
Historically, the civil rights movement in the United States exemplifies the strength of a community of voices. Led by figures like Martin Luther King Jr., this movement united individuals from diverse backgrounds in a shared struggle for justice and equality. The collective efforts of these voices led to landmark legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, showcasing the undeniable power of communal action in effecting legislative and societal change.

### Body Section 3: Addressing Counterarguments
While individual voices have sparked change, the sustainability and broader impact of these efforts often rely on the formation of a community. For instance, the initial act of Rosa Parks refusing to give up her seat catalyzed a broader bus boycott, demonstrating how individual actions gain momentum and efficacy when embraced by a community. Moreover, the challenges of forming cohesive communities can be mitigated through shared goals and effective communication, further reinforcing the argument for the necessity of collective voices.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the creation of a community of voices is paramount in speaking truths and effecting change. The examples of environmental activism and the civil rights movement illustrate the transformative power of collective action. As society faces ongoing and emerging challenges, recognizing and fostering communities of voices will be essential for advocating progress and justice, affirming Kingston's claim about the importance of a united community in speaking truth.

This draft iteratively builds each section of the response, ensuring a coherent flow and a strong argumentative structure that supports the thesis.

RESPONSE:
Fear is a powerful motivator that has been used for both good and ill as long as humans have walked the Earth. As a small child, you're taught to fear fires, storms, and lightning, and to be wary of cars while crossing the street as a safety measure. However, using fear as a method of reasoning or as a means to change minds or incite positive change rarely works. Attempts to persuade others through fear are seldom effective and can even sow resentment, inhibiting positive change from occurring.
When I was younger, my parents tried to scare me into obeying them with threats of privilege removal, time being taken away, or simply being confined to my room. This often didn't work. If anything, their attempts to scare me into doing "the right thing" only made me more determined to do the opposite. Any positive changes I could have made to be safer as a child were fought against solely because I disliked being scared into doing things. I indeed resented my parents for trying to control me through fear, which prevented any good they were trying to achieve from taking root. If reasoning and explanations had been given when what I perceived as completely unfair and often unnecessary rules were told to me, perhaps I would have been more receptive. Instead, the fear instilled in me turned into anger and resentment towards those who tried to change my mind, namely my parents.
The use of fear as a motivator also proved unsuccessful in the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, which began at the close of World War Two. Upon discovering that the United States had nuclear weapons, the Soviets stole the secrets of the technology and created their own in response. This theft and the creation of the most powerful weapons known to man at the time were driven by fear. The fear of nuclear war and massive destruction led to a significant spike in the production of nuclear weapons, which had incited the problem. In addition to the fear of death from nuclear weapons that most Americans experienced at that time, there was also suspicion and resentment towards anything perceived as "red" or communist. The concern that the Soviets would kill Americans with nuclear weapons evolved into resentment, which became another motivating factor behind the increased numbers of nuclear warheads in America. It was not until the 1960s that a slight compromise was reached and levels of fear decreased, leading to more cooperation in the 1970s when the number of nuclear weapons was reduced and controlled. This positive change and involvement in the issue of nuclear weapons wasn't brought about by fear, but by a wish for a better future and a willingness to cooperate with others towards a common goal.
While fear is often seen as a potent motivator that drives people to respond quickly and allows them to be persuaded more easily and quickly, this is not always the case. The use of fear to persuade others seldom leads to genuine positive change or persuasion. It most often causes the opposite, as seen in personal experience and in global affairs, especially regarding the Cold War.
