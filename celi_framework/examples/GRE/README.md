# GRE Writing Task Assistant

## Problem Statement

The GRE (Graduate Record Examination) writing section, known as the Analytical Writing Assessment, comprises two tasks:

1. Analyze an Issue
2. Analyze an Argument

This example focuses on the "Analyze an Issue" task, using CELI (Conversational Enhancement and Language Intelligence) to generate high-scoring essays.

## Our Solution

We've developed a system that leverages CELI to write essays that consistently score 6 on the GRE rubric. Our approach involves:

1. **Job Descriptions**: Detailed instructions for CELI on how to approach and write these essays.
2. **Custom Tools**: A set of tools to assist in the writing process, automatically invoked by CELI controllers as needed.

## Key Features

- Consistently generates essays scoring 6 on the GRE rubric
- Automated tool integration for enhanced writing support
- Scalable solution adaptable to various "Analyze an Issue" prompts

## Getting Started

To run CELI against the **GRE** benchmark, use the following JobDescription (probably set in your .env file): 
- Make sure your .env is set up correctly (look at .env.example) and set `JOB_DESCRIPTION=celi_framework.examples.gre.job_description.job_description` specifically.
- From a terminal, and from root of project directory, run `python -m celi_framework.main`. This will output a json file (with timestamp) with the answers in GRE/target/celi_output/drafts. That's the "output file".

## Evaluation

Essays generated by this system are scored using the official GRE rubric, found in `GRE/data/scoring_guidelines/`
