        - Ensure each drafted section transitions smoothly into the next, maintaining a coherent flow throughout the document.

    Task 5
    Task_name: Synthesize Sections into a Draft
    Description: After drafting individual sections, this task involves combining them into a single, cohesive final draft. The objective is to ensure that the document flows logically from introduction to conclusion, maintaining a unified argument that effectively addresses the prompt.
    Instructions:
        - Combine the drafted sections starting with the introduction, followed by the body sections, and ending with the conclusion.
        - Ensure that transitions between sections are smooth and logical, enhancing the overall flow and readability of the document.
        - Check that the final draft maintains a consistent style, tone, and voice throughout, which are important for presenting a professional and coherent argument.
        - Review the entire document to ensure that it aligns with the response strategy and meets the structural and content expectations outlined previously.

    Task 6
    Task_name: Review Draft
    Description: This final review task is crucial for ensuring that the complete document meets the established criteria, drawing on insights and structures developed in previous tasks.
    Instructions:
        - Use the 'retrieve_instructions' function to fetch a prompt and answer pair for a similar question, ensuring alignment with standard response formats and expectations.
        - Review each section of the document to confirm it follows the logical flow and depth outlined, comparing it with the retrieved example where necessary.
        - Check that the thesis is clearly stated in the introduction and is effectively supported throughout the body sections.
        - Verify that the conclusion effectively summarizes the arguments and reinforces the thesis.
        - Ensure that each section transitions smoothly into the next, maintaining a coherent narrative flow.
        - Assess the use of evidence to ensure it is pertinent and effectively integrated into the argument.

    Task 7
    Task_name: Recommend Revisions with Review Output
    Description: This task involves identifying necessary revisions based on detailed feedback and assessments provided in the 'Draft Review' task. The goal is to pinpoint areas where the document can be improved to meet established criteria, thus enhancing clarity, coherence, and argumentative strength based on the review outputs.
    Instructions:
        - Review the feedback provided in the 'Section Review', 'Draft Quality', and 'Final Verdict' components from the Draft Review.
        - Identify key areas requiring improvementâ€”these may include areas where argumentation needs to be strengthened, the thesis needs to be clearer, transitions between sections need to be smoother, or grammatical and formatting errors need to be corrected.
        - Recommend specific revisions for each section of the document, focusing on the areas highlighted in the feedback.
        - Suggest re-evaluation of the evidence used in the response to ensure it aligns well with the thesis and supports the overall argument effectively.
        - Propose how to ensure that all recommended revisions will maintain the logical flow and coherence of the response, thus enhancing its overall persuasive impact.

    Task 8
    Task_name: Redraft
    Description: Redraft with recommended revisions.
    Instructions:
        - Revise each of the sections and subsections drafted separately in 'Iteratively Draft Each Section of the Response'.
        - Execute these revisions as sub-tasks, ensuring each section and sub-section is handled one at a time to maintain focus and precision.
        - Make sure to incorporate all recommended revisions to enhance the clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness of each section.
        - Reassess each redrafted section to ensure that the revisions are appropriately integrated and that the section aligns with the overall strategy and response outline.
    Note:
        - This task needs to be executed as sub-tasks. Draft each section and sub-section separately in sequential prompts/completions (one response at a time).
    Example:
        - Example Revised Section: "Introduction: [Revised draft text of introduction here, incorporating feedback and enhancing clarity and engagement.]" 
    ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
        - Be very critical during the redrafting process. Try to identify any remaining weaknesses or areas for improvement.
        - Pay special attention to maintaining a logical flow between sections, ensuring that transitions are smooth and support the overall argument.
