            Here is typical feedback that you have received for prior drafts. Make sure you are addressing the previous concerns:
            Based on the GREÂ® Scoring Guide provided, the essay you've written would likely receive a Score 5 (out of 6). Here's the rationale for this assessment:
            
            Clear and Well-Considered Position: The essay presents a clear and articulated position that cooperation rather than competition is essential for nurturing future leaders capable of tackling modern societal complexities. This aligns well with the task's requirements.
            Development with Logically Sound Reasons and Examples: The position is developed using logically sound reasons and well-chosen examples, such as the collaboration on the international space station to illustrate effective teamwork leading to significant achievements. However, the depth of analysis and the variety of examples might benefit from further expansion to fully realize a score of 6.
            Focus and Organization: The essay maintains a general focus and organization. It logically structures the argument from introduction through to conclusion, though there could be smoother transitions and a more nuanced exploration of competing viewpoints to enhance the logical flow and depth of analysis.
            Clarity and Appropriateness of Language: The essay uses clear and appropriate language, employing a decent range of vocabulary and sentence structures. It conveys ideas effectively, although to achieve a score of 6, the essay could benefit from even more varied sentence structures and more precise vocabulary to enhance clarity and impact.
            Conventions of Standard Written English: The essay demonstrates a good command of standard written English, with only minor errors. The grammatical structure is solid, supporting the overall clarity and readability of the essay.
            A section is considered complete once there are no more revisions required. If there are revisions recommended then go back to Task Synthesize Sections into a Draft.
            
            Justification for Not Awarding a Score of 6:
            While the essay is robust, to achieve a score of 6, it would require a slightly more insightful and nuanced analysis, particularly in exploring the limitations of cooperation or how it interacts with competition in more depth.
            A score of 6 would also typically involve demonstrating superior skill in the use of language, including more sophisticated syntax and richer vocabulary.
