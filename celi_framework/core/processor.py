"""This Python module, celi_framework.processor, is part of a larger system designed to automate the drafting of
documents using language models. The module contains the ProcessRunner class, which is responsible for managing and
orchestrating the drafting process.

The ProcessRunner class interacts with various utility functions and MongoDB for data storage and retrieval,
optimizing the process through adaptive learning and feedback mechanisms. It also leverages a MasterTemplateFactory
for dynamic task management, ensuring a structured approach to document creation based on a predefined configuration
and schema.

The module must be run from main.py in the root directory. It imports various utility functions and classes from
multiple modules, including llm_helper_funcs, llmcore_utils, TokenSplitter, token_counters, and exceptions. These
imported functions and classes provide essential functionalities for parsing messages, managing tokens,
handling exceptions, and splitting tokens, among others.

The module also defines several constants related to token pricing and maximum spend.
These constants are used to manage the costs associated with using language models for content generation.

The ProcessRunner class is initialized with a master template, codex, id prefix, new JSON document, document directory,
drafts directory, update queue, and a configuration. It also accepts an optional list of sections to skip.

The class includes numerous methods for managing the drafting process, such as generating task instructions,
saving templates, restarting the process, saving prompts and completions, dispatching function calls, running the
main execution loop, processing iterations, retrieving responses, handling responses, updating prompt completions,
checking token limits, handling draft settings, handling table settings, handling context popping, logging errors,
and stopping the process.

Each method in the ProcessRunner class plays a specific role in the drafting process, from initiating and managing
the main execution loop to handling responses from the language model and updating the ongoing conversation context.
The class ensures that each interaction with the language model contributes towards the completion of the document,
while also managing token usage to prevent excessive costs."""

    """
    The ProcessRunner class orchestrates document drafting by managing a sequence of tasks that interact with language
    models for content generation and refinement. It leverages a MasterTemplateFactory for dynamic task management based
    on a predefined configuration and schema, ensuring a structured approach to document creation.

    This class is central to automating the drafting process, utilizing natural language processing to generate,
    analyze, and refine text based on source material and expert guidance. It interacts closely with utility functions
    and MongoDB for data storage and retrieval, optimizing the process through adaptive learning and feedback mechanisms.

    Args:
        master_template (MasterTemplateFactory): Factory instance to manage task templates.
        codex (MongoDBUtilitySingleton): Persistent storage - holds the LLM cache and CELI output
        tool_implementations (ToolImplementations): Tools that CELI can call
        llm_cache (bool): Whether to cache LLM requests
        skip_section_list (List[str]): Optional list of sections to skip in the processing

    The ProcessRunner class encapsulates the complexity of automating document drafting, providing a structured and adaptive framework for content generation, analysis, and refinement. It represents a key component in leveraging AI and NLP technologies for enhancing the efficiency and quality of documentation.
