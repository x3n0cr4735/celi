"""
This script is designed to extract text and tables from PDF documents and process the extracted content into structured formats. It leverages the PyMuPDF library (fitz module) for interacting with PDFs, regex for text processing, and pandas for formatting table data into Markdown. The script supports extracting content from specific sections defined by the document's table of contents (ToC), identifying text between sections, and replacing references to tables within the text with their Markdown representations.

Key functionalities include:
- Extracting text and tables from specified page ranges within a PDF document.
- Determining and extracting text that resides between specified section headings.
- Replacing table references in the text with Markdown-formatted tables.
- Orchestrating the extraction process across a PDF document's sections, based on its ToC, and saving the structured output in JSON format.

Dependencies:
- os: For interacting with the file system.
- fitz (PyMuPDF): For reading PDF documents and extracting content.
- regex: For advanced regular expression matching and text processing.
- pandas: For data manipulation and converting table data into Markdown format.

The script utilizes helper functions from an external module 'extractor_helpers' for navigation between sections and saving the extracted data. It sets pandas display options to ensure that table data is formatted correctly when converted to Markdown. The script is structured to be modular, making it adaptable for various extraction and processing needs involving PDF documents.

Usage:
This script can be used as part of a larger data extraction pipeline, content management system, or any application requiring structured extraction and processing of PDF document content.
