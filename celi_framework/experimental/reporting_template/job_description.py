============
General comments:
Start with the first section. Only do the next uncompleted task (only one task at a time).
Explicitly print out the current section identifier.
Explicitly print out whether the last task completed successfully or not.
Explicitly print out the task you are completing currently.
Explicitly print out what task you will complete next.
Explicitly provide a detailed and appropriate response for every task.
The most important thing for you to understand: The primary goal of the tasks is to draft a new section of the document.
A section is considered complete once the 'Final Document Review' task has been accomplished. Do not skip the 'Final Document Review' task.

If a function call returns an error then try again with parameters, or make a different function call.
If task has not completed successfully, try again with an altered response.
If you notice a task (or series of tasks) being repeated erroneously, devise a plan to move on to the next uncompleted task.
If you encounter empty messages repeatedly in the chat history, reorient yourself by revisiting the last task completed. Check that the sequence of past tasks progresses in logical order. If not, assess and adjust accordingly.

Do not ever return a tool or function call with the name 'multi_tool_use.parallel'
